# programming-courses

This is a repository where I organize and track my progress through various programming courses and tutorials.

The goal of this repository is to:

- Consolidate code, notes, and hands-on exercises from multiple online courses
- Bridge theoretical concepts with real-world coding practice
- Preserve meaningful commits to reflect learning effort over time
- Revisit key topics or build from them in the future

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository contains code and personal notes from various programming courses and tutorials I’ve followed — including both free and paid content.

The purpose of this repository is strictly educational and personal. It serves as:

- A structured archive of what I’ve learned
- A way to reinforce concepts by practicing them hands-on
- A transparent log of my development and growth as a programmer

Some code and notes may closely resemble or replicate the material from the original courses, as part of the intended "follow-along" structure. However:

- **I do not claim ownership of the course content or original ideas.**
- **I will not monetize, redistribute, or republish any part of the course materials.**
- Course names or references are included for attribution and clarity only.
- No course media, proprietary resources, or downloadable materials (e.g., videos, PDFs, starter packs) are included or shared.

If you're a course author and have concerns about any specific material, feel free to reach out via GitHub, and I’ll address it immediately.
